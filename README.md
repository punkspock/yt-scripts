# yt-scripts
This is my personal repository for scripts using the Python module yt. The
repository is located on the department GitLab server (gitlab.physast.uga.edu)
and accessible from Lyra (office computer, 306C) or my personal Mac. 

Notes: 
The repository is for code, NOT data or data products.

The project is designed to be passed on to a new owner should I leave the 
department GitLab. The code is meant to be useful for other people.

This code is for working with FLASH data in the Shelton group.
